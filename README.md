# Welcome

The intent of this repository is to provide a single repository where I can teach myself something I'm interested in learning.  This can be anything from programming
languages, algorithms, package/libraries, new features, etc.  It will contain different branches for each of the different projects that will be worked on.  The intent
is to have this file list the different projects within this repository.  At the moment, I haven't decided what information will be contained within this file.
