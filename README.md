Welcome to my project in which I will be using to improve my current knowledge of the C++ language and gain more experience using
CMake to build, test and package libraries.  While the main objective is to reach the goals that I set out in the prior statement. 
The other objective is to transfer some of the knowledge that I've gained programming in other languages into C++.  While that is
one other objective, there is also the other objective of learning new C++ features that are interesting to me and that can become
useful in the future.
