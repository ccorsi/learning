This plugin was developed to be able to track the amount of time that someone spends on a given web site.  This information
will be stored locally within an indexedDB datasource that is connected to the browser that the plugin was installed in. The
current implementation of this plugin will be for Mozilla FireFox browser.  It is possible in the future that this will also
be available for the other browsers like, Chrome, Safari, Edge and others.  This will depend on how portable the implementation
of this plugin will be vis-a-vis the other browsers.
