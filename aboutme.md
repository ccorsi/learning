# Welcome

My name is Claudio Corsi and I created this web site for several reasons.  The main reason is to learn how to use GitHub Pages so that I can then
document some of my existing projects or any new projects.  There is also the need for me to be able to add more content to my job applications.  This
web site will contain more detailed information about my experience and what I have been learning.  Its objective is to allow prospective employers a
chance to get a deeper sense of my experiences throughout my career.  Lastly, it is just the possiblily of creating a blog about anything that
interests me.  Let me now expand on the points mentioned above.

# Learning

As part of the process of creating a web site, one has to learn to take advantage of what is already available.  Well, in that respect I thought that
using one of the many theme pages would be something worth pursuing.  Well, that has not panned out as well as I had hoped.  I have then decided to
use [Dean Attali Beautiful Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) which he has been working on for several years.  There is a lot
of useful information that is provided by his work that has allowed me to get started more quickly.  This web site will then be taking advantage of
that effort and in turn I will be able to work on the look and feel of this web site.  That said, you will find that I will be experimenting
throughout the lifetime of this web site using different features.  This will hopefully allow me to also create a quality resume page that will not be
a reference to a pdf file.  Let us now move to the next phase and talk about my work experience.

# Work Experience

As I have mentioned above, I will now talk about my work experience and how this will be showcased [here](../resume).  Let me then start by stating that
I have been a software engineer for more than 25 years.  Throughout this time, I have had a chance to learn many different aspects of being a software
engineer, this includes different programming languages, operating systems, architecting, designing, testing, concurrency, parallel, etc.  I will be
expanding on these details within the experience section referenced above.

# Blogging

I have always wanted to blog about different subjects that interest me.  I tried to start one using wordpress but they started to add advertisement to
the blog entries, it became unpleasent for me as a writer and for anyone that found themselves reading those pages.  I have then decided to give it
another go using this web site.  It is my hope that this time around I shall be able to produce more blog entries than I have been able to produce in
the past.

# Conclusion

I'd like to conclude that you will find areas of this web site that will contain incomplete entries that will be populated in the future.  As with any
effort needed to create a web site, the main task will be rewriting and reworking of the content.  This is something that will become part of this
process.  It is hoped that sooner rather than later these changes will become less frequent and that those changes will only be accounted by the newly
added pages.  That being said, I do hope that you will enjoy what you see and that you get something from this endeavor.

Thanks for coming along,

Claudio
