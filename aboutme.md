# Welcome

My name is Claudio Corsi and I created this web site for several reasons.  The main reason is to learn how to use GitHub Pages so that I can then
document some of the other projects that I have created or any new projects.  There is also the need for me to be able to add more content to my
job applications.  This web site will contain more detailed information about my experience and what I have been learning.  It's objective is to
allow prospective employers to take a deeper look into my experiences throughout my career.  While the last reason is just the possiblily of
creating a blog about anything that interests me.  Let us now turn too offering some overview on the points mentioned above.

# Learning

As part of the process of creating a web site, one has to learn to take advantage of what is already available.  Well, in that respect I thought
that using one of the many theme pages would be something worth pursuing.  Well, that has not panned out as well as I had hoped.  I have then
decided to take [Dean Attali Beautiful Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) that he has been working on for the past
five years.  There is a lot of useful information that is provided by his work that has allowed me to get started more quickly.  This web site
will then be taking advantage of that effort and in turn I will be able to work on the look and feel of this web site.  That said, you will
find that I will be experimenting throughout the lifetime of this web site using different features.  This will hopefully allow me to also
create a quality resume page that will not be a reference to a pdf file.  Let us now move to the next phase and talk about my work experience.

# Work Experience

As I have mentioned above, I will now talk about my work experience and how this will be showcased [here](resume).  Let me then start by stating
that I have been a software engineer for than 25 years.

# Blogging

I have always wanted to blog about different subjects that interest me.  I tried to start one using wordpress but alas since they've added
advertisement to the blog entries, it became unpleasent for me as a writer and for anyone that found themselves reading those pages.  I have
then decided to give it another go using this web site.  It is hoped that this time around I shall be able to produce more blog entries than
I have been able to produce in the past.

# Conclusion

I'd like to conclude that you will find areas of this web site that will contain _TODO_ entries that will be populated in the near future.  As
with any effort needed to create a web site.  The main task will be rewriting and reworking of the contents.  This is something that will become
a continuous set of changes that will be part of this process.  It is hoped that sooner rather than later these changes will become less frequent
and that those changes will only be accounted by the newly added pages.  That being said, I do hope that will enjoy what you see and that you get
something from this endeavor.

Thanks for coming along,

Claudio
