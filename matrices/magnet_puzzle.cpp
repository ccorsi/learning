            We are given a set of bipolar magnets, each domino-shaped. The objective is to
            place magnets on an `M × N` board, which satisfies a set of conditions where
            both M and N are not odd.

            For instance, the following problem has the solution on its right:

            https://techiedelight.com/practice/images/Magnet-Puzzle.png

            Each `2 × 1` or `1 × 2` grid in the board can contain a magnet or empty. The
            blank entry will be indicated by X’s, and the magnet will be represented by `+`
            and `-` (For the positive and negative end, respectively). The digits along the
            board’s left and top sides represent the count of `+` squares in corresponding
            rows or columns. Similarly, those along the right and bottom show the total number
            of `-` signs in particular rows or columns. Rows and columns for which no number
            is mentioned can have any number of `+` or `-` signs. The puzzle solution must
            also satisfy the constraint that no two adjacent squares can have the same sign.
            But diagonally joined squares can have the same sign.

            Example 1:

            The top[], bottom[], left[], right[] arrays indicates the count of `+` or `-`
            along the top (+), bottom (-), left (+), and right (-) edges, respectively. The
            value of -1 indicate any number of `+` or `-` signs.

            top[] = [1, -1, -1, 2, 1, -1]
            bottom[] = [2, -1, -1, 2, -1, 3]
            left[] = [2, 3, -1, -1, -1]
            right[] = [-1, -1, -1, 1, -1]

            The rules[][] matrix can contain any T, B, L, or R character. T indicates its top
            end for a vertical slot in the board, and B indicates the bottom end. L indicates
            the left end, and R indicates the right end for a horizontal slot in the board.

            rules[][] =
            [
                [L, R, L, R, T, T],
                [L, R, L, R, B, B],
                [T, T, T, T, L, R],
                [B, B, B, B, T, T],
                [L, R, L, R, B, B]
            ]

            Output:
            [
                [+, -, +, -, X, -],
                [-, +, -, +, X, +],
                [X, X, +, -, +, -],
                [X, X, -, +, X, +],
                [-, +, X, X, X, -]
            ]


            Example 2:

            top[] = [2, -1, -1]
            bottom[] = [-1, -1, 2]
            left[] = [-1, -1, 2, -1]
            right[] = [0, -1, -1, -1]

            rules[][] =
            [
                [T, T, T],
                [B, B, B],
                [T, L, R],
                [B, L, R]
            ]

            Output:
            [
                [+, X, +],
                [-, X, -],
                [+, -, +],
                [-, +, -]
            ]

            The solution should return an empty vector if the solution does not exist.
