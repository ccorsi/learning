            Given an `M Ã— N` boggle board, find a list of all possible words that can be formed
            by a sequence of adjacent characters on the board.

            You are allowed to search a word in all eight possible directions,
            i.e., North, West, South, East, North-East, North-West, South-East, South-West, but
            a word should not have multiple instances of the same cell.

            Input:

            board =
            [
                ['M', 'S', 'E'],
                ['R', 'A', 'T'],
                ['L', 'O', 'N']
            ]

            words = ["STAR", "NOTE", "SAND", "STONE"]

            Output: {"STAR", "NOTE"}
