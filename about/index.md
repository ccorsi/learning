# About

The following will contain information about me and my experience as a software engineer.  These set of pages will contains different levels of information with respect
to my experience thoughout my career.  It will contain a reference to my resume that one can use to get an overview of my experience.  While, that has its usefulness, it
has become apparent that that is not necessarily enough these days.  I am going to also provide information about the different experiences that will expand on what is
already part of my resume.  That will provide prospective employeers that ability to better understand what I have to offer.  These sections might contain duplicate
information but then they might not all be looked at which is part of the objective of these pages.  For instance, if someone is looking for someone that knows the
Python programming language.  They can take a look at my Python page that contains information about my experience using that language.  If they are looking for someone
that knows Machine Learning, they can look at my machine learning page.  Both of these pages will contain information about the use of PYthon and some of this might be
duplicate.  Nonetheless, the objective is to be able clarify some of the possible misconceptions about my experience.
