## Welcome to Claudio Corsi GitHub Pages for my learning Repository

Well, hello there, and welcome to my web site.  This is something that I am putting together for several reasons.  One of these is to promote me by showcasing some of
the work that I have done with some things that I know how to do but have not done within a professional environment.  It looks I need to step back a little and start
by introducing me to you the wondering internet user.  I am a software engineer by trade with a Mathematics B.Sc. that just happens to enjoy building software.  You
see this all started in University and my fascination of the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).  That coincident started me on a path of
learning about computers, even though I tried unsuccesfully to have anything to do with it.  So after many years I am still as excited about working in the compueter
field as when I first started.  It that respect, I will dedicate a section of the web site on my experience at the following [landing page](about).  Now that I have 
shamelessly tried to show off what I can do, let me now start to express what this web site objective is about.

There are several reasons that this web site was created.  One of them is to take advantage of Github [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) as a resource
to create these pages with.  Within this context, I am going to talk about the different projects that are part of this repository as well as some of the other 
repositories of mine.  This will hopefully get some of you interested in using one of more of these projects.  While that is another one of my objective, the other
objective is to use this web site create some blog entries about different interest of mines that have nothing to do with computer science.



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ccorsi/learning/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
