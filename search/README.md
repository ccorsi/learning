# Introduction

The following sub-project contains implementations of different algorithms that I learned when auditing a university course
at Columbia University.  It is will sadness to note that this course was discontinued since I really enjoyed the professor
that was teaching this class.  In my humble opinion, she created a very good course that offered an overview of the field of
AI.  I only wished that Columbia University would reconsider reviving this class and the other classes that were part of the
MicroMasters Program.

That said, this particular project contains the different search implmentations that were taught during one of those classes.
Specifically, it will contain implementations for the different uninformed and informed algorithms.  These implementations
will be implemented using C++ templates so that they can be used with any type of elements.  It is hoped that these
implementations might be of use by others.

# Implementations

We are now in a position to expand on the different type of Search algorithms that will be implemented in the following
section.  This will include information about the different algorithms that will be implemented.  With that, we can end
up including more details about each of these algorithms so that the user of these algorithms can make an informed
decision about which one to use.

Here is a detailed list of the different algorithms that have been or will be implemented here.

| Algorthm | Description |
| :------- | :---------: |
| Breath First Search | |
| Depth First Search | |
| Depth Limited Search | |
| Iterative Deepening Search | |
| Uniform Cost Search | |
| Greedy Best First Search | |
| A* Search | |
| IDA* Search | |

While the following list shows which of the above algorithms have been implemented
