Work Experience:

Client:

	- SCCS
	- git
	- Mercurial
	- Visual SourceSafe
	- subversion
	- CVS
	- Rational ClearCase
	- AccuRev

Services:

	- GitHub
	- GitLab
	- Bitbucket


Those mentioned above are all the ones that I have become very experienced with.

I could mention the fact that I have also used rcs and the snapshot system which was developed
on top of Rational ClearCase source code management system.  The last one was created within
Object Design and was never released as a product, i.e., it is an internal version used to
develop the ObjectStore OODBMS product.
