# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org).

{% comment %}

Mention about the different scripts that I created for Atternity that were used to perform some tasks.  Mention
the major packages that I created that was used to process commits from a GitLab distribution.  I should also
explain the other packages that include the ability to access BugZilla, JIRA and how it uses XML-RPC and REST
calls to retrieve and update data for different issues.

This should also include my use of the different testing mechanisms to test that the product was working as
expected.

Talk about my climenu and contract projects that was released on pypi.  These are something that they can then
look at and also use.
