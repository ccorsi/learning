# Introduction

This page contains information about the different Open Source Projects that I have on my 
<a href="https://github.com/ccorsi?tab=repositories" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. and
<a href="https://replit.com/@ccorsi" target="_blank">ReplIt</a> accounts.

I should talk about the different projects that I have implemented.  These should include
future projects that I intend to create and hopefully use or should I wait until I have
started those projects?  Maybe, I should just explain what I want to learn when implementing
those projects.

Here is an example of a project.

Project Dynamic Library Loading using C/C++

	I want to create a project that will check if a particular library has been updated.
	If it has, I will then load it and then call a callback method that will be manage
	replacing the prior loaded version of the library.  The callback was added so that
	a user can perform whatever checks that it needs to insure that the generated code
	is valid.  This can also include other checks like versioning and whatnot.  Note
	that this library can also be used to check for any type of file updates.  I wonder
	if it can also be used to check for communication updates using, tcp, udp, http and
	other protocols.  This might be a good project to implement in the future.  This 
	project will be very useful when implementing it using CMake.

Project Dynamic File Loading using Java

	This project will be similar as the C/C++ version except that it will be for the
	Java programming language.  I wonder if I can implement something similar for other
	languages like, Python, Ruby, Perl and Go.   

The above projects are inspired by the Erlang programming language which was created to be
fault-talurent programming language.  

Create one or more Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Reinforcement Learning/AI Projects

	This project objective is to try and implement one or more of these projects using 
	different programming languages.  These will mainly be implemented using the Python
	programming language.  As part of this work, I hope to be able to add a performance
	boost using CPython that would replace the slower locking mechanisms of Python. 
	There is also the possibility of implementing these projects using R, Julia and Java
	but these are not necessarily something that I need to do.  I think that I might
	just implement something using the Julia programming language.
