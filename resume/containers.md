# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of Containers, specifically [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Docker

# Conclusion

While I have only really worked with Docker within a working environment.  It is my objective to be able to
expand my knowledge of containers like kubernetes, nix, openstack and others.  This is something that has
become an important requirement to be able to work more within a cloud environment.

Talk about how I have used Docker to build and test our APM product.  How I have used it to update the minimal
Operating System requirements for the APM product.  What is it that I ma comfortable about.  Talk about getting
a chance to use RedHat podman container engine but that it did not work with our current Docker configuration
files.  We were then forced to put this work aside untill we were able to fix that issue.  Alas, I didn't get
a chance to do that since our group was reduced from 6 to 1 engineers.

I should also mention that I should consider learning the composer feature of the product.

The issue is that Kubernetes has leaped frog past Docker and it might be a better idea to learn how to use that
instead of Docker.  There is also the RedHat replacement of Docker which is called Podman.  This was developed
to mimic the Docker commands.  It has been noted that when I tried using this product with a Dockerfile, it
failed to build and run the defined container.
