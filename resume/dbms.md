# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of different Database Management Systems that I have used
in and out of a working environment.  This includes my knowledge of SQL and NoSQL systems.

# SQL DBMS

This section will contain the different database systems that are SQL based.  The following sections will
contain information about my knowledge of these different systems and where I have been used.

## Oracle Enterprise RDBMS

## DB2 RDBMS

## Ingres RDBMS

## Derby

Derby is a pure Java RDBMS

## HSQLDB RDBMS

The hsqldb database is a pure java database system that is mainly used within an embedded system.  This system
was used to test the integration of our product with database systems that implement the JDBC specifictions.

## H2 RDBMS

The h2 database is a pure java database system that is mainly used within an embedded system.  This system
was used to test the integration of our product with database systems that implement the JDBC specifications.

# NoSQL DBMS

The following sections contains the NoSQL database systems that I have knowledge in and out of a working
environment.

## MongoDB

The MongoDB database system is a NoSQL system that I have used within a .NET and Java development environment.
My knowledge of this system is that I require

## OrientDB

The orientdb database management system is a NoSQL system that I have used out of a working environment. This
database system is used for document or graph data.  I have created a simple project that uses a orientdb
system to store data for a list of books where each book can contain different attributes, for example books
can contain zero or more authors, editors or translators.

# OODBMS

The following sections contain the knowledge of object oriented database management systems in and out of
a working environment.

## ObjectStore

The ObjectStore Enterprise DBMS is an object orient database system that was developed by Object Design.  This
is a product that I was part of the development team.  I have experience using this database management system
using C++ or Java.

# Conclusion

I have knowledge of several different database management systems from relational, object-oriented and NoSQL
systems.
