# Introduction

Here I will discussing the different knowledge that I have gained in and out of the work environment using the [Java
programming language](https://openjdk.java.net/){:target="_blank"}.  

# How it all Started

My venture into the Java programming language started when I was working for Object Design.  I was initially hired to
support ObjectStore OODBMS C++ client code base.  I must admit that I don't know when or even why I started to become
interested in Java during my time that I spent working at Object Design.  I started working for them because I wanted to
gain more C++ experience since was always an objective of mine.  The fact that I found myself drawn to ObjectStore Java
layer is somewhat of a surprise in and of itself.  When I decided to pursue this path, I didn't even know how to program
in Java.  I then spent the next several months reading and learning about Java and the ObjectStore OSJI and JMTL Java
layers of the ObjectStore product.  After supporting the product for some time, I pursued an engineer position of the
ObjectStore JMTL layer.  I went through the interview process and transfered of the position.  Upon joining the group, I
was then asked to understand this layer which required knowledge about the use of threads and everything related to this
model.  The JMTL layer, (Java Middle-tier Transaction Layer), was designed to remove the need to have users of the
product concern themselves with managing the transactions with the database system and just concetn themselves with the
business requires.  We started noticing that many of our customers would implement Transaction Managers to handle the
ObjectStore transaction within the database.  It then became clear that providing such a feature with ObjectStore would
be a benefit to everyone that uses our product.  This in turn would reduce the number of coding cycles needed to
implement their business logic using our JMTL product.

Talk about working for FUSESource in which I had a chance to work with the Apache Projects of ActiveMQ, Camel,
ServiceMIX their associated projects.

Talk about my code contribution to the Camel, Logging, ActiveMQ and Karaf projects.  The issue is that only the logging
framework was the one that the changes were applied by myself while the rest of the changes were applied by the
developers of those projects.

Talk about my experience using Java at Emptoris

My experience of using Java at Riverbed/Aternity.

Mentioned that this was used within Progress Software with respect to ObjectStore JMTL and OSJI products.  I've
also used this at Atternity and Emptoris.

Talk about the different frameworks that I used throughout that time and with which products that those frameworks
were integrated with.
