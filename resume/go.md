# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of the [Go programming language](https://go.dev/).

{% comment %}

I should talk about the small/medium size project that I created on Replit to learn Go.  This should
explain the use of the function/method and go calls that are part of the core language.  I should
also consider creating a more elaborate project on github that shows my understanding of those
features and other more elaborate features that I did not use within that project.  This should also
include creating tests and benchmarks that will provide information about my ability to program
with Go.
