# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of the [Go programming language](https://go.dev/).
I started to learn to develop with the Go programming language in 2020.  I was curious how the language 
can be used and decided to create a project that will read and print a Java class file.  This was something
that I did outside of a work environment since I wasn't required to use the Go programming language.  
While implementing this project I started to get more comfortable with the programming language itself.
The included how to create structures that could be extended as well as structure that only contained
attributes.

I should talk about the small/medium size project that I created on Replit to learn Go.  This should
explain the use of the function/method and go calls that are part of the core language.  I should
also consider creating a more elaborate project on github that shows my understanding of those
features and other more elaborate features that I did not use within that project.  This should also
include creating tests and benchmarks that will provide information about my ability to program
with Go.
