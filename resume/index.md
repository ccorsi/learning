# Introduction

The following pages will contain information about my work experience as a Software Engineer.  As part of this information, I
will also include technologies that I have learned outside of the work environment.  This is anything from programming languages,
operating systems, tools and other technologies.  Finally, I will include different readings that I have done during the years
that might be useful for those that are interested in what kind of technologies I have read about.  While this information can
be fairly long,  I have sectioned out this information within fairly compact pages.  If one is only interested in my resume then
you have two choices to choose from.  You can either look at my [web page](resume) or you can download a pdf version of it
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccorsi/learning/docs/assets/pdf/ClaudioCorsiCV.pdf).  Let me know explain how the rest 
of these pages are going to be organized.

These set of pages that expand on my work experience and self taught interests will be divided into pages that are work experience
related and self-taught interests.  While these can be extensive, I've tried to section them out such that it will be easier for
one to look at specific experience that one finds useful.  Let me then describe the different sections and what they are going to
be about.

The following table contains all of the different technologies that I've used within a working environment and were they've been
used.

| *Technologies* | *Companies* |
| :--- | :--- |
| [C/C++](c-cpp) | Aternity, Riverbed, FUSE Source, Progress Software, Ciber, Bell Sygma, Ranmar |
| [Java](java) | Aternity, Riverbed, Progress Software, Emptoris, FUSE Source |
| [Python](python) | Aternity, Riverbed |
| [Perl](perl) | Progress Software |
| Ruby | FUSE Source |
| .NET | Aternity, Riverbed |
| Groovy | Aternity |
| Docker | Aternity |
| Shell Scripting | Aternity, Riverbed, FUSE Source, Progress Software, Emptoris, CIBER, Bell Sygma, Ranmar |
| Concurrent and Parallel Programming | Aternity, Riverbed, FUSE Source, Progress Software, Bell Sygma |
| IDE Tools | Aternity, Riverbed, FUSE Source, Progres Software, Emptoris, CIBER, Bell Sygma, Veritech, Ranmar |
| SCM Tools | Aternity, Riverbed, FUSE Source, Progres Software, Emptoris, CIBER, Bell Sygma, Veritech, Ranmar |
| Application Servers | Aternity, Riverbed, FUSE Source, Progres Software |
| CD/CI Tools | Aternity, Riverbed |
| Office Tools | Aternity, Riverbed, FUSE Source, Progres Software, Emptoris, CIBER, Bell Sygma, Veritech, Ranmar |
| Testing | Aternity, Riverbed, FUSE Source, Progres Software, Emptoris, CIBER, Bell Sygma, Veritech, Ranmar |
| Agile Development Process | Aternity, Riverbed, Progress Software |

The following table contains the different technologies that I have taught myself but have not had a chance to use
within a working environment.

| *Technologies* |
| :---: | 
| JavaScript |
| Erlang |
| Go |
| Scala |
| Julia |

Note that some of my knowledge of the above technologies are fairly minor while some like I have done some extensive work like 
Go and JavaScript.

To be continued....

I have over 25 years experience within the Computer Science field.  This length of time has seen me develop products for backend and
frontend.  This included the use of different programming languages like, C/C++, Java for different operating systems
like Windows and Linux.  While this is only a small sample of this information.


# More to Come...

Since, this is a work in progress and you might want to know more about me since there is more say.  Here is a list
of tasks that I will create:

- [ ] [C/C++](c-cpp)
- [ ] [Python](python)
- [ ] [Java](java)
- [ ] [Groovy](groovy)
- [ ] [Perl](perl)
- [ ] [Ruby](ruby)
- [ ] [.NET, specifically C#, Experience](dotnet)
- [ ] [Shell Scripting](scripting)
- [ ] [Machine Learning Knowledge](ml)
- [ ] [Concurrent and Parallel Programming]()
- [ ] [IDE Tools](idetools)
- [ ] [Source Code Management System Tools (git and company)](scms)
- [ ] [Database Management Systems](dbms)
- [ ] [Operating Systems](operatingsystems)
- [ ] [JavaScript](javascript)
- [ ] [Application Servers](appservers)
- [ ] [Continuous Development/Continuous Integration Tools](cdci)
- [ ] [Docker](containers)
- [ ] [Office Tools](officetools)
- [ ] [Erlang](erlang)
- [ ] [Clojure](clojure)
- [ ] [Julia](julia)
- [ ] [Testing](testing)

The above list will contain information about the particular experience and knowledge around those knowledges. This
will include what level of experience and in which work related job that I was using that knowledge.  The list also
includes knowledge that was not necessarily applied within a work environment but is something that I have found of
interest that I also hope to be able to use in the future.  For example, I have become interested in Machine 
Learning recently and I am looking for oppurtunities to apply this knowledge within a working environment.
