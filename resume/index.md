# Introduction

The following pages will contain information about my work experience as a Software Engineer.  I have over 25 years
experience within the Computer Science field.  This length of time has seen me develop products for backend and
frontend.  This included the use of different programming languages like, C/C++, Java for different operating systems
like Windows and Linux.  While this is only a small sample of this information.

# More to Come...

Since, this is a work in progress and you might want to know more about me since there is more say.  Here is a list
of tasks that I will create:

- [ ] [C/C++](c-cpp)
- [ ] [Python](python)
- [ ] [Java](java)
- [ ] [Groovy](groovy)
- [ ] [Perl](perl)
- [ ] [Ruby](ruby)
- [ ] [.NET, specifically C#, Experience](dotnet)
- [ ] [Shell Scripting](scripting)
- [ ] [Machine Learning Knowledge](ml)
- [ ] [Concurrent and Parallel Programming]()
- [ ] [IDE Tools](idetools)
- [ ] [Source Code Management System Tools (git and company)](scms)
- [ ] [Database Management Systems](dbms)
- [ ] [Operating Systems](operatingsystems)
- [ ] [JavaScript](javascript)
- [ ] [Application Servers](appservers)
- [ ] [Continuous Development/Continuous Integration Tools](cdci)
- [ ] [Docker](containers)
- [ ] [Office Tools](officetools)
- [ ] [Erlang](erlang)
- [ ] [Clojure](clojure)
- [ ] [Julia](julia)
- [ ] [Testing](testing)

The above list will contain information about the particular experience and knowledge around those knowledges. This
will include what level of experience and in which work related job that I was using that knowledge.  The list also
includes knowledge that was not necessarily applied within a work environment but is something that I have found of
interest that I also hope to be able to use in the future.  For example, I have become interested in Machine 
Learning recently and I am looking for oppurtunities to apply this knowledge within a working environment.
