# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of the [Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

Gained Work Experience at FUSESource where I developed a simple tool that would automate a fairly simple process
that was a tedious when done by hand but easily automated.

What was the program that I created for?  I think that it had to do with something with processing support type
issues.  What can I state about this type of dynamic programming language?  Maybe I should create a similar
program that would be able to process data and then extract information about the data.  This can be something
that can then be used as an example of my understanding of the use of the ruby programming language.
