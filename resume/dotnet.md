Alas the only time that I used .NET within a working environment is at Atternity.  During this time, I
have used it using the C# programming language.  This was also being used with the MongoDB .NET client
that Atternity APM manages.  Describe that I developed the initial version of our product integration
with the MongoDB .NET client.
