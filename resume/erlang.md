# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of the [Erlang programming language](https://www.erlang.org/).

Mention that I was following the erlang tutorial on the official website and that what appealed me to this
language was the fact that you can make changes to the code within production while it is executing and then
applying those changes without having to shutdown the system.
