# Introduction

Here I will discuss the different development building tools that I have used in and out of a working environment.
These tools have been mainly used to build products using C/C++ and Java.  There are also some tools that I have used to
build products using Python that have not been used within a working environent.  In what follows, I will be discussing
how each of these tools were used in and out of a working environment.

# Make and CMake

The use of make and its other flavors like nmake and cmake is something that I have used throughout my career.  These
tools have become an essential part of the building and testing of products that I have been involved with.  The earlier
years of my career required that I understand how to create and update Makefiles.  This was required because at that
time, we didn't have interactive development tools that could generate the require Makefile targets for you.  The need
to be able to understand and extend the definitions of Makefiles allowed me to be able to gain knowledge of how to build
products using these tools.  This has helped me better understand the options that different compilers use to build products

Here are a list of the building tools that I have used within a work environment:

	- nmake (Object Design/Progress Software/CIBER/Veritech)
	- make (Object Design/Progress Software/Riverbed/Aternity/Bell Sygma/Ranmar Business System)
	- maven (Object Design/Progress Software/Riverbed/Aternity/FUSESource)
	- cmake (Riverbed/Aternity)
	- Ant/Ivy (Object Design/Progress Software/Riverbed/Aternity)

Here is a list of build tools that I'd like to be able to learn:

	- gradle

What other tools have I used to build the product?  I can talk about my use of Nexus and Archiva.
Specifically, how I have used Nexus as a local distribution of the different libraries used within
my projects such that they aren't accessed within our company intranet everytime I build my product
locally on my machine.  Explain how this was setup on a guest vm and used by one or more vm to get
the required libraries during my build process.
