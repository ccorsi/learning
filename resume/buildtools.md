# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of different tools used to build and package products.

Here are a list of the building tools that I have used within a work environment:

	- nmake (Object Design/Progress Software/CIBER/Veritech)
	- make (Object Design/Progress Software/Riverbed/Aternity/Bell Sygma/Ranmar Business System)
	- maven (Object Design/Progress Software/Riverbed/Aternity/FUSESource)
	- cmake (Riverbed/Aternity)
	- Ant/Ivy (Object Design/Progress Software/Riverbed/Aternity)

Here is a list of build tools that I'd like to be able to learn:

	- gradle

What other tools have I used to build the product?  I can talk about my use of Nexus and Archiva.
Specifically, how I have used Nexus as a local distribution of the different libraries used within
my projects such that they aren't accessed within our company intranet everytime I build my product
locally on my machine.  Explain how this was setup on a guest vm and used by one or more vm to get
the required libraries during my build process.
