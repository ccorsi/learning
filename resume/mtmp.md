This page contains information about my knowledge of concurrent and parallel programming.

Talk about my experience of using multi-threaded applications within JMTL and how the need
to be able to understand and implement concurrency access within Atternity APM product.
Talk about my use of semaphores, shared memory and RPC at Bell Sygma.


Should mention my use and knowledge of Sockets and the concept of UDP and TCP.  How they
can be used.  How I was using this for testing and communication between products.
