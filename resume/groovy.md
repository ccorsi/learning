# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of the [Groovy programming language](https://groovy-lang.org).

Mention that this was used when I was porting the Jenkins Pipeline implementation to using a Jenkinsfile to build
the APM product at Atternity.   Talk about how I used Groovy to be able span nodes that would build the product
on different systems that we support.  This should also show some or my abilities to use the language.  It would
also make sense to create a small project that shows what I can do with the language.
