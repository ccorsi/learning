# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of different IDE that I have used throughout my career.  I will then 
talk about each of the different IDE tools that I have worked with.

# Visual Studio

The Visual Studio IDE is the first IDE that I have had a chance to work with within a working environment.  I have used
this IDE throughout my career for differnt companies.  I have become comfortable using this IDE for C/C++ and C# projects.
This includes the different aspects of working with the source files and debugging the application. 

# Visual Studio Code

The Visual Studio Code IDE is something that I have been using outside of a working environment.  I have used this to 
develop products that use C/C++, C#, Go and JavaScript programming languages. 

# IntelliJ

The IntelliJ IDE is something that I have used in and out a work environment.  I have had to understand how to use its
different features including its debugging capabilities.  This IDE was used to develop projects that use the Ant and Maven
build system.  

# PyCharm

The PyCharm IDE is something that I have mainly used out of a work environment.  I have used this IDE to create some 
personal projects that allow me to extend my knowledge of Python beyond what I have learned through the development and
use of Python in a work environment.  It has allowed me to be more productive compared to the IDE that I used in a work
environment.  I have taken advantage of its integration with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) so that I can use
specific environments to develop and test different projects.

# Eclipse

The Eclipse IDE was something that I started to use mainly with Java projects.  I have used this IDE with a C/C++ project
but that wasn't is primary use.  I have had to understand how to use the IDE with projects that use Ant, Maven or just 
Eclipse project settings.

# NetBeans

The NetBeans IDE wasn't something that was used extensively since I would use Eclipse and then IntelliJ instead.  While
my knowledge is limited, it nonetheless was very useful with projects that was using Ant as the build tool.  NetBeans has
an extensive integration with Ant and by default uses Ant when it creates a new project.  This IDE was mainly used to
create and build some personal projects.  I have come to prefer to the use of IntelliJ and Eclipse IDEs instead.

# Notepad++

The Notepad++ IDE was something that I have used within a work environment.  This was something that because useful when
using a windows operating system since it is only available on windows.  It basically is Notepad on steriods and it does
not disappoint in that respect.  It is something that was very useful until I had found better IDEs that could be used
instead of the Notepad++ IDE.  I have found it useful since it is able to edit more than one type of programming 
language.  It can be used to look at C/C++, C#, Java, Python and other programming languages and be able to properly
edit the source files.

# Emacs/XEmacs

The Emacs/XEmacs IDE is one of the oldest IDE that exists and it is still being used throughout.  This IDE is something
that I have been using to edit source file from different programming language.  The programming languages that I have
edited using Emacs/XEmacs for work are C/C++, Perl, Tcl/Tk, shell scripts, Java, C#, Python, Groovy and others.  It
is an IDE that it not being used as often since there are more modern IDE that have a better interface.  It nonetheless
is something that can still be used to develop.

# Vim/vi

While Vim/vi is not really an IDE per se, it nonetheless does provide some IDE functionality that I have benefitted from. 
I have mainly used vi to accomplish my source code changes.  Its use has mainly been when creating and updating shell
scripts on *nix mainly.  While it has also been used to edit windows shell scripts.  I have had to become comfortable 
with using the extended features of Vim/vi, like the ability to find and replace action using a regular expression.  The
usefulness of using Vim/vi goes beyond just helping to develop but it has also seen its usefulness with its use within
an remote system in which their isn't the possibility to use a full fledge IDE.
