# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of the [Clojure programming language](https://clojure.org).

{% comment %}

This is something that I was interested in because of the fact the Clojure is a Lisp based programming language.
I have already used Emacs Elisp configuration language to build emacs extensions for commands that I have used
extensively.

This is something that might be useful within a job but I doubt it.
