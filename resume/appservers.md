# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of the different application servers that I have used within and
outside of a working environment.  The different type of application servers used range from web servers to
full fledge application servers.  I will then discuss each type in turn and offer information on when and in what
capacity these servers have been used.

# Web Servers

The use of web servers has grown throughout the years, the main features of these servers is to manage web activities.
While there are and have been many products to choose from here. I have had the oppurtunity to work with Apache HTTP
server, Tomcat, Jetty and IIS.

## Apache HTTP Server

While Apache HTTP Server is one of the most popular web server in the world.  My experience with this product has been
limited to host test results access from our products unit and system tests.  This need came about because the unit and
system tests where not kept beyond the next test run.  This required that I take of the test results that also included
logs from one or more product runs and place them within the network where the Apache HTTP Server was hosting.

## Tomcat

The Tomcat web server is one of the products that I have used the most within a work environment.  This product was used
to test our integrations of our product with respect to products that used the Servlets and/or Jsp features of Tomcat.

## Jetty

The Jetty web server was also used extensively within the same context as the Tomcat web server.  I used this product to
insure that what worked with Tomcat was also working with Jetty.  The value of this product was that I was able to gain
more confidence with our integration of our product with the Servlet and Jsp specifications.

## IIS

While IIS is something that I have used within a working environment, my experience of using this web server is limited.
My use of IIS was more with just processing simple pages that did not use any of the Microsoft specific frameworks like
ASP .NET.  Which leads me to mention that my work experience and non-work experience is very limited.

While my experience of using web servers has involved several different products.  My experience with application
servers has not been as broad but still involved several products.  I will discuss my knowledge of application
servers next.

# Application Servers

The following sections will discuss my experience using the different application servers that I had to use within a
working environment.

## Oracle WebLogic Application Server

Oracle's WebLogic Application Server was one of the first application servers that I had to learn and use within a
working environment.  I needed to know how to use the application server different services.  These include the use of
Servlets and Enterprise JavaBeans.

## IBM WebSphere Application Server

The IBM WebSphere Application Server is another product that I needed to understand how to use its Servlets and Enterprise
JavaBeans features.  This also include how to the Jsp implementation works.

## JBoss Application Server

JBoss Application Server is another application server that I needed to understand how to use Servlets and Enterprise JavaBeans.

## GlassFish Application Server

The GlassFish application server was something that I have used within a working environment.  It is not a product that
I used as often as the WebLogic Application Server and the WebSphere Application Server.  This was based on the fact
that this application server was not something that our customers would use to develop and deploy their products on.  It
basically became another tools to test our product against.  The main advantage of this product is that it is the
reference implementation of the Java Enterprise Specifications.  This was then used to insure that our products was
still functioning correctly with the newer releases of the specifications.  It would give us a chance to enhance our
product with the new features that will be implemented in the WebLogic Applcation Server and WebSphere Application
Server.

# Conclusion

While I've gain knowledge with many different web and application servers, this knowledge was mainly acquired within a
working environment.  Though this knowledge is not extensive because of the kind of work that I was doing.  It
nonetheless required that I learned how to integrate my product within these different servers.  This effort required
that I understand the internal aspects of the different products.

TODO: We should include the different application servers that I have worked with and
also application servers that I have also learned about outside of a job environment.

The list of application servers that I have actually work with in a working environent
are:

	- Oracle WebLogic Server
	- WebSphere Application Server
	- Tomcat
	- Resin
	- Jetty
	- JBoss Application Server


The following application servers which I have used outside of a work environment are:

	- GlassFish
	- WildFly

Do I have any application server that I would be interested in learning?

	- IIS


Where does Apache http server within this section?   Should this be included or not?
It is more of a web server then an application server.  It is something that I have
used within a working environment to perform simple tasks but most of this time
this is something that has been setup by the IT department.
