# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of the different application servers.

TODO: We should include the different application servers that I have worked with and
also application servers that I have also learned about outside of a job environment.

The list of application servers that I have actually work with in a working environent
are:

	- Oracle WebLogic Server
	- WebSphere Application Server
	- Tomcat
	- Resin
	- Jetty
	- JBoss Application Server


The following application servers which I have used outside of a work environment are:

	- GlassFish
	- WildFly

Do I have any application server that I would be interested in learning?

	- IIS


Where does Apache http server within this section?   Should this be included or not?
It is more of a web server then an application server.  It is something that I have
used within a working environment to perform simple tasks but most of this time
this is something that has been setup by the IT department.
