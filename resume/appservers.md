# Introduction

This page contains information about my knowledge of the different application servers that I have used within and
outside of a working environment.  The different type of application servers that I have used ranged from web servers to
full fledge application servers.  I will then discuss each type in turn and offer information on when and in what
capacity that these servers have been used.  I will then discuss my experience of using web servers in the next section.

# Web Servers

The use of web servers has grown throughout the years, the main features of these servers is to manage web activities.
While there are and have been many products to choose from here. I have had the oppurtunity to work with Apache HTTP
server, Tomcat, Jetty and IIS.

## Apache HTTP Server

## Tomcat

## Jetty

## IIS

While IIS is something that I have used within a working environment, my experience of using this web server is limited.
My use of IIS was more with just processing simple pages that did not use any of the Microsoft specific frameworks like
ASP .NET.  Which leads me to mention that my work experience and non-work experience is very limited.

While my experience of using web servers has involved several different products.  My experience with application
servers has not been as broad but still involved several products.  I will discuss my knowledge of application
servers next.

# Application Servers

## Oracle WebLogic Application Server

## IBM WebSphere Application Server

## JBoss Application Server

## GlassFish Application Server

# Conclusion

While I've gain knowledge about many different web and application servers, this knowledge was mainly acquired within a
working environment.  Though this knowledge is not extensive because of the kind of work that I was doing.  It
nonetheless required that I needed to learn how to integrate my product within these different servers.

TODO: We should include the different application servers that I have worked with and
also application servers that I have also learned about outside of a job environment.

The list of application servers that I have actually work with in a working environent
are:

	- Oracle WebLogic Server
	- WebSphere Application Server
	- Tomcat
	- Resin
	- Jetty
	- JBoss Application Server


The following application servers which I have used outside of a work environment are:

	- GlassFish
	- WildFly

Do I have any application server that I would be interested in learning?

	- IIS


Where does Apache http server within this section?   Should this be included or not?
It is more of a web server then an application server.  It is something that I have
used within a working environment to perform simple tasks but most of this time
this is something that has been setup by the IT department.
