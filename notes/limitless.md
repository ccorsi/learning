# Focus

We will start with one of the biggest hurdle that one needs to overcome to be able to take advantage of the other techniques described here.  The primary reason
that one is unable to focus is the distractions that seep through our focus.  The ability to filter these distractions is one of the main goals that we are trying
to accomplish.  How does one go about doing just that?   The first step to allowing one to focus is through the ability to concentrate on the task at hand.  The
process of concentrating is an ability that can be trained.  This leads one to ask how does one go about learning to concentrate.  This can only be accomplished
through practice.  The biggest hurdle is finding something to concentrate on and then practicing concentrating on that task.  When one finds themselves being
distracted.  One should then bring ourselves back to concentrating on the task at hand through will power.  Some might note that that is easier said than done.
Well, that is true but through practice one becomes better at redirecting our contrantration back to what we were doing.
