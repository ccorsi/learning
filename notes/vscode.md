The following page contains information that I have found useful when using
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>.  This information is
something that I apply infrequently and tend to forget afterwards.  This thus causes me to spend more
time than necessary trying to remember how I did that thing I am looking for.  Well, my solution is
to add it here such that I won't forget how to perform these infrequent settings and whatnot.

# Extensions

While there are many different extensions that one can use.  There are some that I have found useful for my own development. Before I begin
to discribe the ones that I use let me start by mentioning some general information about extensions.

A vscode,(Visual Studio Code), extension can offer one of more configuration settings that make it possible to use that extension.
