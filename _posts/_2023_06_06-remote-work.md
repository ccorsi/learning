Since the advid of the Pandemic, there has been more acceptance to working from home.  This is especially the case within the software field.
It has become more acceptable that more of us work from home.  Though this is not the only field that has had more individuals working from
home.  I will then talk about my experience working from home.  It's advantages and disadvantages through my own eyes.  While these points
have been mentioned by others.  They will have my own flavor about them.

I have mostly worked exclusively from home since my first born.  It has been more than 2 decades worth of experience.  This doesn't imply
that I am an expert on how to work from home. What is does imply is that I have learned more than enough to be able to work from home
sucessfully.  While this is my opinion, I hope that some of what I mention here can benefit others that are starting to work from home.

Let me then begin by stating that working from home is not for everyone.  This doesn't imply that one shouldn't try to work from home but
that one should understand if working from home is really something you can manage.  The key word here is "manage" since working from
home does require someone to manage their time effectively.  This is just one of the many aspect that one needs to be able to perform
when working from home.  In my opinion it is the main one for anyone that wants to work from home needs to master.  One cannot be
successful working from home unless you can manage your time.  This includes that ability to deal with what is expected with respect to
work and also what is expected from being at home.  The ability to seperate the two is how well someone can actually work from home.
In my opinion, the ability to work from home is geared towards autonomous individuals and not very well suited for individuals that
require attention.
