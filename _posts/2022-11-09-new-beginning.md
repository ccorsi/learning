As you must have already surmised, this is something new by someone who wants to start blogging. It isn't
something that I am good at at the moment but hopefully I will get better at it as I go along.  I wanted
to start this blog using github pages and learn how one can create and use this nice feature.  I had
intended to create the web site using the available themes with github pages but after some research I
decided to use [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/) [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/).
This does not imply that I am going to necessarily stick with this tool but at the moment this offers me
the required features to be able to get started quickly enough.  Let us now talk about the objective of
this site.

The main reason that I have started this blog is to be able to talk about things that interest me.  This
can include something that I would like to remember.  While I don't believe that this site will have 
any followers, which has never been my objective.  If I do gain followers than thanks for following me.
Hopefully, you will be able to get something from these posts.  While most of my posts will be connected
to different aspects of computer science.  I do hope to be able to post about things that are not related
to computer science.  You see, I have a insatiable desire to learn about different things.  I hope to be
able to write about those old and new interests. 

That being said, I just wanted to finish this post by saying hello to anyone and everyone that is reading
my posts.  I hope you enjoy them and thank you for coming.
